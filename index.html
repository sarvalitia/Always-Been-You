<p class="par">You know that I don't believe in love at first sight but i always had a feeling that this could be something more when I first saw you but less face it ,you didn't even notice me. You don't know how beautiful my life seems after you became a part of it. You have always been there for me through my hard times nd my silly insecurity episodes holding my hand saying "It's okay babe , you will get through. When I look back at college, the only great memories that I have are the silly arguments and deep talks  I shared with you which always makes me smile or chuckle as u would say. Eventhough I say that you don't express yourself, But I know that my girl always cares about me when I need it the most. I remember me telling that it was a little overwhelming this afternoon but I realise now that its all gonna be great if you are right next to me because I love you. Look what you made me do - AM WRITING A LOVE LETTER ! but it's ok because you mean the WORLD to me."</p>
